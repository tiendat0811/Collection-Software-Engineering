## Compiler

- What is compiler?
  In computing, a compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language). The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g. assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program

- Why is compiler needed?
  Because computer can't understand the source code directly. It will understand only object level code. Source codes are human readable format but the system cannot understand it. So, the compiler is intermediate between human readable format and machine-readable format

- What is thread?
  In computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system.

- What is the difference between Single-thread and Multi-thread?
  - **Single threaded** processes contain the execution of instructions in a single sequence. In other words, one command is processes at a time.
  - **Multi threaded** allow the execution of multiple parts of a program at the same time. These are lightweight processes available within the process. Share code, data, file.
  - Advantages of Multithreaded:
    - Share its resources such as memory, data, files etc
    - Economical to use threads as they share the process resources
    - Program responsiveness allows a program to run even if part of it is blocked using multithreading. This can also be done if the process is performing a lengthy operation
  - Disadvantages of Multithreaded:
    - Multithreaded processes are quite complicated. Coding for these can only be handled by expert programmers
    - It is difficult to handle concurrency in multithreaded processes. This may lead to complications and future problems
