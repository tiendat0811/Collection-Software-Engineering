## What is user interface (UI)?

Is what we see on the screen and interact with the computer through coded commands.

Simpler than UI is how users see the design of the program on the desktop, laptop, handheld computer (table) or smartphone.

## What are UI libraries?

A UI library, in the simplest terms, is a collection of materials, or components, that you can readily use or modify to meet your needs. You can think of UI **components** as single elements available in that library, such as buttons, input fields, or banners made out of pure HTML and CSS.

## What is State Management?

State management refers to the management of the state of one or more user interface controls such as text fields, OK buttons, radio buttons, etc. in a graphical user interface. In this user interface programming technique, the state of one UI control depends on the state of other UI controls.

## Why state management required?

When you have state management in place data actually flows from your app to state and vice versa. You know exactly where your data is. These state management tools also give you a point-in-time snapshot of the entire data. In that way, you know exactly where your data is and that makes your development faster.
